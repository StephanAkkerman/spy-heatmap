# S&P 500 Heatmap 📊

This project is a simple Python script that generates a heatmap of the S&P 500 index using the data from the Unusual Whales API. It is meant to look like the heatmap on the [Unusual Whales website](https://unusualwhales.com/heatmaps).

## Introduction

If you have traded stocks you have probably come across the S&P 500 index and the heatmaps that are used to visualize the performance of the index. It provides a quick overview of the performance of the index and can be used to identify trends and patterns. There are many sites that provide these heatmaps, but I wanted to create my own version using Python.
